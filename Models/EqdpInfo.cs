/// whose model bit is unset wears another race's model; a race whose material bit is unset looks
/// the material up under the base race of its gender, which is why gear materials are named
/// c0101 (male) and c0201 (female).

/// the material bit for the base race whose name its materials carry — the game does not ship one
