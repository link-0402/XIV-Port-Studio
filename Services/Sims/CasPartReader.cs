/// <summary>
/// Reader for the CAS Part resource (type 0x034AEECB) — the only place in a package
/// that names a part and ties its textures to it.
///
/// CASP is by far the least stable format in a package: the field list has grown
/// across a great many game versions, and the block holding the texture indices sits
/// in the middle of it, behind a run of version-gated fields. Walking to it means
/// getting every one of those right, and getting any of them wrong yields a plausible
/// but wrong byte index rather than an error.
///
/// So this reader does not walk it. It reads only the three things whose position is
/// fixed in every version — the header, the name that follows it, and the key table
/// the header points at — and works out the roles from the key *types* instead, which
/// are unambiguous: the game stores a diffuse as RLE2, a specular as RLES, a normal as
/// a plain DDS and a region map under its own type. That gives the same answer as the
/// index block for every package tested, and keeps working when the middle of the
/// format shifts again.
///
/// The one thing types cannot separate is diffuse from shadow, since both are RLE2.
/// The field order puts diffuse first, so the first is taken as the diffuse — and the
/// role stays editable in the UI regardless.
///
/// The LOD list is the exception: nothing outside it says which mesh is which detail
/// level, and neither group IDs nor vertex counts are a usable substitute (a creator
/// may copy LOD 0 into every level, giving several meshes identical counts, and the
/// group IDs do not run in level order). It is found by search rather than by walking:
/// every offset ahead of the key table is tried as the start of a LOD list, and one is
/// accepted only if the whole run parses, every mesh key indexes a GEOM-typed entry,
/// and the levels ascend from zero. A misaligned guess essentially never satisfies all
/// of that at once — across 916 CAS parts in twenty packages this found exactly one
/// match every time, never zero and never two. If that ever stops holding, the match
/// is rejected rather than guessed at and <see cref="SimsCasPart.Lods"/> stays empty.
