/// <summary>
/// Writes a parsed GEOM out as a binary glTF (.glb) for Blender.
///
/// Nothing is converted on the way out: positions, normals, winding and UVs all pass
/// through as they are stored. Sims geometry already matches glTF — Y-up, right-handed,
/// counter-clockwise, with the UV origin at the top left — so any "conversion" here
/// would corrupt it rather than fix it.
///
/// Both halves of that were measured rather than assumed, because both mistakes hide
/// well. Negating an axis and flipping the winding to match mirrors the model, and a
/// mirrored body still looks anatomically correct with its normals still facing
/// outward, so a render will not show it; it was caught by comparing the geometric
/// normal implied by each triangle's vertex order against the normals stored beside it
/// in the file, which agree on every mesh tested. Flipping V puts the whole mesh on the
/// transparent half of the sheet; it was caught by sampling the diffuse at every vertex
/// UV, where the stored orientation covers 57% of the artwork and the flipped one 0%.
/// Do not reintroduce either without re-running those checks.
///
/// Skinning is exported as a flat armature rather than the real rig. A GEOM carries
/// only FNV-32 hashes of the bone names it is weighted to, and the actual bind pose
/// lives in a _RIG resource that CAS packages normally reference rather than contain.
/// Since the mesh is already stored in bind pose, emitting one identity joint per bone
/// gives Blender the vertex groups — usable for transferring weights between meshes
/// from the same package — without needing the rig itself. When the hashes could not
/// be read the joints are numbered instead; the names are cosmetic, what matters is
/// that the same bone keeps the same group across meshes.
