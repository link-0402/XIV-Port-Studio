/// image looks, for two reasons: it is what actually decides whether the crop is safe,
/// and emptiness on its own can be undecidable — a placeholder texture is blank in both
/// halves, and a Sims normal map is fully opaque in both. Texture content is still
/// checked afterwards, but only to report a crop that would discard something.
